MIDI Router Development/Build 

VSCode:
* Install platform i/o and make sure you have the arduino/teensy frameworks
* Open "MidiRouter.code-workspace" with VSCode 
* Verify that platformio.ini has the correct teensy36 board and arduino framework selected
* Open main.cpp and then "Run Build Task", either from the Terminal window or using the check mark build icon in the vscode UI 
  (usually in the upper right, or ctrl+option+B on MacOS). There should be no build errors or warnings.
* Load the compiled code into the teensy using the Upload icon (same location as the build icon, or ctrl+option+B on MacOS)
* The Teensyloader should open and run. If the code doesn't load the first time, power cycle the MIDI Router and try uploading again. 
  If that doesn't work, you may need to open the MIDI Router and press the pushbutton on the Teensy.

I had to make the following modifications:

~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoteensy/libraries/MIDI/src/serialMIDI.h:30 - add #include "midi_Defs.h" 
~/.platformio/packages/framework-arduinoteensy/libraries/RA8875/src/RA8875.h:150 - add #include <SPI.h>
